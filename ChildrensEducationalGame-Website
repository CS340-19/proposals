Hi, we are Alexis & David and we have an idea for an educational game or website that teaches young children basic programming 
concepts. We need two more members and are very open to modifying the idea. It is definitely not set in stone.

Just email us at aengelvi@vols.utk.edu if you need a group. Thanks!
