Project Proposal:

What: Browser Addon which allows for real-time analysis of tweets in order to "better" inform the twitter populace.
Who: For everybody (that uses Twitter)
How: Javascript - addon implentation, Python - webcrawler/twitter api access and machine learning tools
Process: Directly interact with the addon to (or maybe directly put it on the page) connect the story to whatever
 tweet to isolate. (Isolating by directly opening the tweet)
