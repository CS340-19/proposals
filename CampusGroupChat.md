Our project will be developing an app that allows students at UT to communicate with each other in an easier way and encourages them to make connections with others on campus. 

Our app will function similarly to other "group chat" apps, but will contain different "channels" that allow users to connect to those on campus with similar interests. The main channel will be for those within the same building or area on campus, helping them to meet new people in their vicinity.
