Hi, we are Alexis, David & Russell and we have an idea for an educational game or website that teaches young children basic programming 
concepts. We need one more member and are very open to modifying the idea. It is definitely not set in stone.

Just email us at aengelvi@vols.utk.edu if you need a group. Thanks!
