Our team is developing a wavetable synthensizer in C++ with a GUI frontend.  Wavetable synthsis is a way
of producing artificial sound with circular tables of samples or wavetables each having one period (cycle)
per table.  These waves are produced with pure math, and can be manipulated to create complex sounds.
When the wavetables are combined together, whole songs can be created.
