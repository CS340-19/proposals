Our team is developing a wavetable synthensizer in C++ with a GUI frontend.  Wavetable synthsis is a way<br/>
of producing artificial sound with circular tables of samples or wavetables each having one period (cycle)<br/>
per table.  These waves are produced with pure math, and can be manipulated to create complex sounds.<br/>
When the wavetables are combined together, whole songs can be created.<br/>
