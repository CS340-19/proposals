So far our team consists of Syd Shelby, Abby Prosise, Emily Plank, Alex Nehls and Derek Sun.

We would like to make an Android App that is a gift giving guide.

Each User of the app would have a personal profile of gift preferences. These preferences would come from an initial quiz and later from recieved gifts and private ratings. Possible gifts will be selected with a ml algorithm that learns from user preferences. Products will be pulled from Amazon's Product API.

As a gift giver, I could go look at a friend's profile and filter possible gifts by price, select a gift, and purchase it from Amazon.

As a gift receiver, I could privately rate gifts I receive in order to improve the ml algorithm's selections.

Feel free to shoot me an email: sshelby3@vols.utk.edu
